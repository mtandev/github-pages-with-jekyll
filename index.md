In this space I'll be talking about:

- My experiences while learning to code
  - The challenges I faced when learning to code coming from a non technical background
  - The *best* and **worst** bootcamps
  - The best place to start learning
  - The 5 most useful resources I kept returning to
  
 - Being a woman in tech
 - Overcoming the impostor syndrome
 
 ... and lots of other exciting coding related topics! :computer:
